# HASSANA
Don't be scared, this isn't malicious code.
You can upload any Python or HTML/CSS files, as well as JavaScript, on this repository, under certain conditions:
1. They cannot be malicious.
2. Make sure they're appropriate.
3. I will check python files for malicious code, and html pages for bad content whenever possible.

Failure to comply will result in me making this private.
